      <p>Varanasi is one of the oldest living cities in the world. Its prominence in Hindu mythology is virtually unrevealed. Mark Twain, the English author and literature, who was enthralled by the legend and sanctity of Benaras, once wrote, "Benaras is older than history, older than tradition, older even than legend and looks twice as old as all of them put together".</p>
